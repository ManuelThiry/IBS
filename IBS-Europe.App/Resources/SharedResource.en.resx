        <value>&lt;h2 class="mb-3"&gt;Why IBS Europe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    Backed by the experience of three generations, we wanted to rethink this model: &lt;strong&gt;Insurance Broker’s Solution®&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;We DESIGN&lt;/strong&gt; Simple, Efficient, and Transparent contracts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;We FIND&lt;/strong&gt; insurers to cover the risks we have identified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;We ISSUE and MANAGE&lt;/strong&gt; both contracts and claims.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start mb-5"&gt;
    We provide a modern and high-quality &lt;strong&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;, both for the broker and the insured.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="mb-3"&gt;Our commitments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="text-start mb-5"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Deliver added value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Design contracts that, based on our experience, meet the needs of the insured.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Find reliable insurers to cover financial risks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manage in an open and modern way.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Present clear contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Handle claims quickly, fairly, and efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A "Client-centric" mindset present in every employee.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A commitment to respond within 8 working hours.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A high level of personalization.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The best Quality-Price ratio by eliminating redundancies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class="mb-3"&gt;Why Luxembourg?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    Because we believe that the market is becoming international, even for individuals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    Because Luxembourg is the "legitimate" place for the free provision of services related to finance and insurance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start mb-5"&gt;
    Because with today's technology, a "back-office" operates in the same way no matter where it is located geographically.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="mb-3"&gt;Our goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="text-start"&gt;
    To give you time to focus on your client relationships by providing you with exclusive and modern products, and by taking care of most of your administrative tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AssurMiFID Conduct Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanbreda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The Vanbreda group consists of a set of companies involved in insurance brokerage, various insurance activities, wealth management, risk management, claims handling, and/or activities that are an extension of these. Each company within the group is recognized by the FSMA as an independent broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vanbreda group in Belgium consists of: Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits – FSMA no. 13718 A-R (BE 0404.055.676), Vanbreda Ausloos – FSMA no. 47833 A (BE 0474.182.421), Vanbreda Credinco – FSMA no. 042518 A (BE 0462.175.702), Vanbreda Geerts – FSMA no. 044401 A (BE 0466.513.679), Vanbreda Huysmans – FSMA no. 067446 A (BE 0478.505.552), Vanbreda Missinne – FSMA no. 013584 A (BE 0426.071.906).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vanbreda group is represented in the Netherlands by Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits Nederland and in Luxembourg by Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits S.A.&lt;br&gt;
    The Vanbreda group maintains close ties with the insurance company Justitia. Justitia specializes in insuring Employee Benefits plans tailored by the Vanbreda group to meet the needs of corporate policyholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Operating Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insurance Intermediation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an insurance broker, our specialization is offering and managing insurance contracts and providing advice about them. To do this, we carry out the preparatory work for concluding insurance contracts and assist in managing and implementing them, including the filing of claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the information you provide, we develop an optimal solution for you. It is therefore important that you inform us in advance with accuracy about all known circumstances, and we reasonably expect these to be considered as data having an influence on the proposal we will make to you. Our advice is always based on an impartial analysis. In other words, our analysis is based on a sufficient number of available insurance solutions on the market that meet your needs and wishes. By concluding the contract, you acknowledge that our advice takes into account your needs and wishes and that you have been informed about the scope and limitations of the insurance product you have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Insurance Branches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies within the Vanbreda group can act as insurance brokers in all the branches of insurance listed below. If a specific branch is not authorized for a company, this is mentioned next to the branch. Due to its niche specialty, Vanbreda Credinco is only authorized for branches 14, 15, and 21.&lt;/p&gt;

    </data>
    <data name="Po-Text" xml:space="preserve">
        <value>&lt;p&gt;For years, Vanbreda group companies have placed great importance on respecting privacy. We handle the personal data of every individual with care and in compliance with applicable legislation, regardless of whether the individual is a (potential) policyholder, an insured person, a victim, a beneficiary, a contact person within a company, a witness, an expert, etc. This statement explains why Vanbreda collects personal data, what we do with it, and what your rights are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Who is the Vanbreda group?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vanbreda group is a collection of companies involved in insurance brokerage and various insurance activities, providing advice, wealth management, risk management, claims handling, and/or activities extending from these. Each company within the group is recognized as an independent insurance broker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Belgium, the Vanbreda group includes: Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits – FSMA no. 13718 A-R (BE 0404.055.676), Vanbreda Ausloos – FSMA no. 47833 A (BE 0474.182.421), Vanbreda Credinco – FSMA no. 042518 A (BE 0462.175.702), Vanbreda Geerts – FSMA no. 044401 A (BE 0466.513.679), Vanbreda Huysmans – FSMA no. 067446 A (BE 0478.505.552), Vanbreda Missinne – FSMA no. 013584 A (BE 0426.071.906), Vanbreda Cornelis – FSMA no. 12565 A (BE 0425.054.196).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, the Vanbreda group is represented by Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits Nederland, and in Luxembourg by Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits S.A. The Vanbreda group has close ties with the insurance company Justitia. Justitia specializes in Employee Benefits insurance plans developed by the Vanbreda group tailored to the corporate policyholder’s needs. The data controller of your personal data is the Vanbreda company that collected it. This statement refers to this data controller as Vanbreda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. What personal data do we process?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, we process the following personal data: your identity data, contact details, health data, financial data, national register number, etc. We process this personal data only for one of the reasons listed under point 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Your rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.1 You can consult your personal data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know if and what personal data concerning you is processed by Vanbreda, you can request to consult it. Vanbreda will provide you with the most comprehensive overview possible of the personal data it processes in its active files. Given the large amount of personal data processed by Vanbreda, we ask that you specify which information or processing activities your request concerns. Personal data that is only included in backup files or logs, or that cannot be directly associated with you, will not be included. Given the sensitivity of health data, it is not sent by default. For this, we ask you to indicate to which doctor we can send it so that it will be available to you through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.2 You can have your personal data corrected&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it turns out that the personal data we process for you is incomplete or incorrect, you can have it corrected and/or updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.3 In some cases, you can have your personal data deleted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal data is automatically deleted after some time. More explanations on this can be found in point 6. If you believe that your personal data is being processed incorrectly, you can request that Vanbreda delete it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.4 You can object to a specific use of your personal data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain situations, you may disagree with the processing of your personal data based on Vanbreda's legitimate interests. In this case, you can object to the processing of your personal data, and Vanbreda will review your specific interests as well as its own. Only if there are compelling legitimate grounds (such as fraud prevention) or in the context of (future) legal action will Vanbreda continue to process your personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, Vanbreda will stop processing it for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.5 You can request restrictions on certain uses of your personal data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask Vanbreda to restrict the processing of your personal data if, for example, you need time to verify the accuracy of your personal data, if the processing is unlawful, if Vanbreda no longer needs the personal data (but you do in the context of legal action), or if you have objected to a processing and the balancing of interests is still under review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.6 You can request the transfer of your personal data to another party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the personal data you have provided to Vanbreda, and which is processed with your consent or based on a contract and through automated means, you can request that it be transferred to you or to another party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.7 You can sometimes refuse decisions made based on automated processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of our processes, decisions are made without human intervention. For example, in the case of a claim settlement where it is clear even to a computer in the specific situation that the reimbursement is straightforward. The existence of such automated decision-making and the underlying logic are indicated during the process. You can always contact your Vanbreda representative if you have questions about automated decision-making or if you do not understand a decision and would like further explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.8 You can withdraw your consent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can withdraw your consent at any time for personal data that Vanbreda processes based on your consent. If you withdraw your consent, Vanbreda may no longer be able to provide certain services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.9 How can you exercise these rights?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to exercise any of these rights, it is important that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You clearly state your request to Vanbreda (including information about the data or activity in question, the type of insurance, your client number, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You identify yourself (for example, through secure online platforms or by providing a copy of your ID).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the importance and impact of your request, Vanbreda may ask for additional information. It is best to send your request to your Vanbreda contact person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any questions or complaints about exercising your rights, you can also contact Vanbreda's Data Protection Officer: using our form, by email at &lt;a href="mailto:dpo@vanbreda.be"&gt;dpo@vanbreda.be&lt;/a&gt; or by mail at Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits S.A., Attn: Data Protection Officer, Plantin en Moretuslei 297, 2140 Antwerp. You can find more information about data protection legislation on the &lt;a href="http://cnpd.public.lu" target="_blank"&gt;cnpd.public.lu&lt;/a&gt; website, the Luxembourg data protection authority's website. You can also file a complaint there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Why do we process your personal data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4.1 To meet legal obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda needs certain personal data to meet its legal obligations. If Vanbreda cannot access this data, it cannot enter into an agreement with you, continue the agreement, or perform a transaction requested by you or a third party on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal provisions that require Vanbreda to process your personal data include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Insurance law, in particular the law of April 4, 2014, and the law of August 2, 2002, on the supervision of the financial sector and financial services;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Anti-money laundering legislation, particularly the law of September 18, 2017;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sanctions legislation, particularly the European Regulation 2580/2001/EC;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Accounting and tax obligations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.2 To conclude and execute the contract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain personal data is necessary to conclude the brokerage agreement or provide the service you can expect from Vanbreda as part of the contract's execution. Vanbreda's service includes providing advice, offering and proposing insurance contracts, as well as carrying out the preparatory work for the conclusion of insurance contracts and their subscription. Finally, Vanbreda will also assist you in managing and executing insurance contracts. It will handle claims and, if necessary, appoint experts or contact other relevant parties and share your personal data with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to use a third-party payment system, Vanbreda will also need to process personal data for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.3 To ensure the proper functioning of our services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda will also process your personal data based on its legitimate interests. The processing performed for this purpose is related to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Customer management;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Central administration within the Vanbreda group;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;General business control, including profitability monitoring;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Risk management, fraud prevention, and compliance;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Legal assistance and defense of our rights;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Monitoring and improving service quality;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Internal auditing;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;IT support for other purposes (e.g., using pseudo-anonymous data in program testing, troubleshooting, etc.);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Network and information security, including access control;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Studies and statistics;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Analysis of website and application usage to improve our products and services;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Direct marketing to existing customers (commercial mailings, event and seminar invitations, sending surveys, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these processes, Vanbreda systematically balances its interests with your rights and reasonable expectations. If you disagree with any of the aforementioned processes, you can object as described in point 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.4 To ensure the proper functioning of our customers' and insurers' services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda will also process your personal data based on the legitimate interests of third parties, such as customers, employers, and insurers. This will only happen if the other party's interest outweighs the impact on your rights and reasonable expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing performed for this purpose includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Statistical reports to customers and employers, for example, to improve working conditions or provide targeted training;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Requests and comparisons of insurance quotes;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Insurance forecasting and underwriting (e.g., work accident insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where possible, this data is shared anonymously with the relevant parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.5 For direct marketing purposes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda aims to offer you products and services that may interest you. Furthermore, we believe it is our responsibility to inform you about new professional risks that could threaten the continuity of your business. To advise you effectively, Vanbreda uses the data at its disposal. Vanbreda thus uses your personal data for direct marketing purposes. Through data analysis, you benefit from a tailored approach, and Vanbreda can provide you with personalized offers. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.6 Because you have given us your consent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain personal data is only processed because you have given Vanbreda your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time without needing to justify your decision. This withdrawal means that the previously authorized processing will no longer be possible in the future. However, withdrawing your consent does not invalidate the processing that took place based on your prior consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. From whom do we receive your personal data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal data may reach Vanbreda in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You have provided it to us yourself, at the beginning or during the collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanbreda has received your personal data from someone close to you (family).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanbreda has received your personal data under a contract with your employer, under which you are an insured/beneficiary/contact person.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanbreda has found this personal data in public sources (e.g., the Belgian Official Gazette, LinkedIn, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Vanbreda has purchased it from third parties, such as a prospecting database to which you have given your consent.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Someone else has provided your personal data to Vanbreda in the context of an insurance contract or claims management.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Someone else has provided your personal data to Vanbreda in the context of a contract with that third party (e.g., a hospital bill sent directly to Vanbreda via AssurCard).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Indirectly (e.g., while browsing our website).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you provide Vanbreda with someone else's personal data, it is important that you inform that person and refer them to this privacy statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. To whom do we provide your personal data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6.1 Vanbreda group&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal data may be shared between Vanbreda group companies. This way, each Vanbreda company is informed about the customer relationship, and you do not have to provide the same information each time. Of course, this does not apply to your medical data. These are only processed by the company within which they were collected. Within the Vanbreda group, only individuals who need specific information for processing will have access to your personal data. The data they have access to depends on the reason for which they need to consult it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6.2 Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda may share your personal data with third parties involved in the execution of a contract or policy. These include (potential) insurers, a company's contact person, experts and advisors (medical), a bank, a mutual fund, etc. Your health data is handled with the utmost care. To avoid processing unnecessary data, we ask you to comply with the agreements made in the insurance policy. Thus, in some circumstances, you are asked to send medical information directly to the insurance company's medical advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Vanbreda shares this data with a third party (e.g., an insurer or your treating physician), it is only in the context of the execution of a contract or the reimbursement of a claim. Vanbreda may also share your personal data with parties involved in claims processing. These include (the insurer of) the other party, experts and advisors (medical), a bank, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure optimal service delivery, Vanbreda relies on several suppliers and subcontractors. To properly perform their tasks, they may need access to your personal data. By entering into a processing agreement with them, Vanbreda sets very clear guidelines regarding how and under what conditions your personal data can be processed. Additionally, Vanbreda also imposes all necessary protection standards on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Vanbreda is legally required, it will share your personal data with the competent public authorities. Important: Vanbreda does not sell your personal data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda aims to process your personal data as much as possible within the European Economic Area, unless strictly necessary for the execution of a contract (e.g., contacting a local expert in case of a claim abroad). If this is not the case, Vanbreda will inform you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. How long do we retain your personal data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanbreda will retain your personal data only as long as Vanbreda needs it to carry out its tasks and defend your interests. In our active systems, we destroy your data no later than the expiration of the liability period for potential complaints. In our backup systems, your data is retained until it is deleted due to the nature of the backup system. If a backup is used, data that is no longer necessary for the purposes described is first deleted from active systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO) for all your questions and concerns regarding the processing of your personal data: &lt;a href="mailto:dpo@vanbreda.be"&gt;dpo@vanbreda.be&lt;/a&gt;, using our form, or by mail to Vanbreda Risk &amp; Benefits S.A., Attn: DPO, Plantin en Moretuslei 297, 2140 Antwerp.&lt;/p&gt;
